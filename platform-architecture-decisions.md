# Platform Architecture Decisions

## 1. Target Platforms
- **Primary**: Responsive web application (desktop, tablet, mobile browsers) to ensure broad reach and rapid iteration.
- **Secondary**: Hybrid mobile applications (iOS and Android) delivered via Capacitor-based wrappers once core web experience stabilizes.
- **Rationale**: Responsive web enables continuous delivery and centralized updates; hybrid approach reuses web codebase while satisfying app store presence requirements and native capabilities (push notifications, offline caching).

## 2. Core Technology Stack
### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript.
- **UI Layer**: Next.js (App Router) for SSR/SSG, internationalization, and SEO.
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Zustand for local state.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with headless component library (e.g., Radix UI) for accessibility.

### Backend
- **Architecture**: Node.js (TypeScript) services on NestJS, organized into modular microservices with API Gateway exposure.
- **API Protocols**: REST for public APIs, GraphQL for consumer apps needing aggregated data, gRPC internally between services.
- **Background Processing**: BullMQ (Redis-backed) for job queues (reservation sync, notification dispatch).

### Data & Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (managed via Amazon RDS) for transactional integrity of reservations, pricing, and customer data.
- **Caching**: Redis (Amazon ElastiCache) for session storage, rate limiting, and frequently accessed inventory data.
- **Search & Aggregation**: Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for full-text search and analytics dashboards.
- **Object Storage**: Amazon S3 for media assets (property images, documents).

### Cloud & DevOps
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS to align with ecosystem maturity and managed services.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized workloads orchestrated via Amazon EKS (Kubernetes) with GitOps deployment (Argo CD).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipelines triggering automated tests, security scanning, and progressive delivery.
- **Observability**: Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing exported to AWS X-Ray, centralized logging in AWS CloudWatch.

## 3. External Integrations
### Online Travel Agencies (OTAs)
- **Booking.com**: Availability/Rate sync via Content API.
- **Airbnb**: Channel Manager API for listing management and reservation updates.
- **Expedia Group**: EPS Rapid API for inventory distribution.
- **Integration Strategy**: Build dedicated integration microservice with pluggable connectors, normalized data model, and resilient retry/queue mechanisms.

### Payment Gateways
- **Primary**: Stripe for card payments, subscriptions, invoicing, and PSD2 compliance support.
- **Regional Backup**: Adyen for multi-currency settlements and alternative payment methods.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Leverage Stripe Radar and Sift integration for high-risk transaction scoring.

### Automation & Operations
- **Marketing Automation**: HubSpot API for CRM sync and email campaigns.
- **Property Automation**: Integrate with smart-lock providers (e.g., August, Yale via APIs) and smart energy management (Sense, Nest) through webhooks and vendor SDKs.
- **Internal Workflow Automation**: Use n8n or Temporal-based orchestration for automated task routing, alerts, and SLA tracking.

## 4. Security & Compliance Standards
- **Authentication & Authorization**: OAuth 2.1 + OpenID Connect using Auth0 as managed identity provider; enforce MFA for staff, PKCE for public clients.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access complemented with attribute-based policies for property/region scoping.
- **Data Protection**: End-to-end TLS (TLS 1.3), database encryption at rest (AWS KMS), per-tenant encryption keys where applicable.
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager with automated rotation; Kubernetes sealed secrets for GitOps workflows.
- **Secure Development Lifecycle**: SAST (GitHub Advanced Security), DAST (OWASP ZAP in CI), dependency scanning (Dependabot), IaC scanning (Checkov for Terraform).
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Centralized audit logging with immutability controls (AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs Insights), anomaly detection alerts.
- **Privacy & RGPD**:
  - Data minimization and retention policies with automatic anonymization after retention periods.
  - Data Processing Agreements with all third parties; maintain Record of Processing Activities (RoPA).
  - Provide data subject access portals, consent management, and breach notification procedures within 72 hours.
- **Compliance Frameworks**: Align with ISO 27001 controls, follow OWASP ASVS for application-level requirements, and PCI DSS SAQ A for payment flows (redirect/hosted payment fields).

## 5. Roadmap Alignment Considerations
- Stage rollout via feature flags (LaunchDarkly) to support iterative delivery aligned with product roadmap.
- Prioritize OTA integration service MVP (Booking.com, Airbnb) before expanding to Expedia and others.
- Ensure data warehouse (Snowflake or BigQuery) is planned in roadmap Phase 2 for analytics once transactional system stable.
- Include penetration testing and disaster recovery tabletop exercises in quarterly roadmap milestones.
